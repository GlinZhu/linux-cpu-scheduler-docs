# Understanding the Linux 2.6.8.1 CPU Scheduler

This paper is intended to be an introduction to the Linux 2.6.8.1 CPU scheduler implementation.

It is available in lyx and pdf formats.

There is also a patch against the Linux 2.6.8.1 sched.c that adds more comments. This did not received as much attention to detail as the paper, but it should be quite accurate.
